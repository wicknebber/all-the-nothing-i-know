<p style="color:#FFFFFF";>i was starting to feel like i had spent my life selling a drug that didn't work.
<p style="color:#FFFFFF";width:200px; word-wrap:break-word;";>it's a quite common experience in christian circles, that feeling of futility, beating your fist to a pulp on a door that rarely opens.
  for many years, i thought i must have been doing something wrong, that god's silence was their way of punishing me for being awful. this song is a turning point, the moment i started feeling like maybe my devotion wasn't being reciprocated. i was done hating myself; i was angry and tired. it felt like the least god could do was acknowledge that after years of faithfulness.
<br >i was also working at a church as a sort of handyman/custodian, which was a good job for a couple years, but it had grown heavy for a lot of complicated reasons. in the midst of that, i'm having baby's first major faith crisis. it was a potent cocktail. i had also discovered drinking to be a pretty effective form of medication that warded off the demons that would swarm when i walked into the church stone cold sober.

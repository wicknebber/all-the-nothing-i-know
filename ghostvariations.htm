  for many years, i thought i must have been doing something wrong, that g_d's silence was their way of punishing me for being awful. this song is a turning point, the moment i started feeling like maybe my devotion wasn't being reciprocated. i was done hating myself. i was mad. i was listening to cowboy dan by modest mouse and drinking too much.
